#+TITLE: cl-alsaseq
#+OPTIONS: num:nil

This is cl-alsaseq, a Common Lisp library for accessing the ALSA MIDI interface. With it, you can send MIDI messages to any program or device that is supported by ALSA.

This library was originally written by Richard Venn, however after he deleted his GitHub account (and the original repo for this project with it), I (modula t.) re-hosted it. I'm also making a few improvements here and there and may do a major cleanup of this system in the future.

* Example usage

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (ql:quickload :cl-alsaseq) ;; Load the system.

  (midihelper:start-midihelper) ;; Start the ALSA MIDI client.

  ;; ...Then connect the "CL" ALSA MIDI source to the destination of your choice.
  ;; I usually use Qjackctl to manage MIDI connections.

  (defparameter *midi-channel* 0)

  (midihelper:send-event (midihelper:ev-noteon *midi-channel* 69 127)) ;; Send a MIDI note on event. 69 is the note number, 127 is the velocity

  (midihelper:send-event (midihelper:ev-noteoff *midi-channel* 69 127)) ;; Send a MIDI note off to stop the previous note.

  (midihelper:send-event (midihelper:ev-pgmchange *midi-channel* 2)) ;; Send a program change message to switch to program #2.
