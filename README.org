#+TITLE: cl-alsaseq

This is cl-alsaseq, a Common Lisp library for accessing the ALSA MIDI interface. With it, you can send and receive MIDI messages to and from any program or device that is supported by ALSA.

This library was originally written by Richard Venn, however after he deleted his GitHub account (and the original repo for this project with it), I (modula t.) re-hosted it.

I'm making a few improvements here and there to the system, however I will likely not be adding this project to Quicklisp, as I would like to produce a better, cleaner version from scratch. The API of this new system would be much simpler and easier to use, but incompatible.

* Example usage

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (ql:quickload :cl-alsaseq) ; Load the system.

  ;; Define a basic handler function for MIDI input.
  (defun midi-map (messages)
    (dolist (message messages)
      (let* ((event-type (getf message :event-type))
             (event-data (getf message :event-data))
             (source (car (getf message :source)))
             (destination (car (getf message :dest))))
        (declare (ignorable source destination))
        (format t "~A: ~S~%"
                (case event-type
                  (:snd_seq_event_noteon "Note on")
                  (:snd_seq_event_noteoff "Note off")
                  (:snd_seq_event_controller "CC")
                  (t event-type))
                event-data))))

  ;; Start the ALSA MIDI client with midi-map function as input handler.
  (midihelper:start-midihelper :master 96 'midi-map)

  ;; ...Then connect the "CL" ALSA MIDI source to the destination of your choice.
  ;; I usually use Qjackctl to manage MIDI connections.

  (defparameter *midi-channel* 0)

  (midihelper:send-event (midihelper:ev-noteon *midi-channel* 69 127)) ; Send a MIDI note on event. 69 is the note number, 127 is the velocity

  (midihelper:send-event (midihelper:ev-noteoff *midi-channel* 69 127)) ; Send a MIDI note off to stop the previous note.

  (midihelper:send-event (midihelper:ev-pgmchange *midi-channel* 2)) ; Send a program change message to switch to program #2.
